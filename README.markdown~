Description: 

The course project will be a clone of del.icio.us. Your project will be a multi-user bookmark storing and sharing web site. I call it pal.atab.le because we will probably not quite get all the way to all the functionality of del.icio.us. The one thing that we will add that is not a part of del.icio.us will be image uploading in some manner.

Here are the required elements of iteration 0. (20 points)

Create a new rails application, name it something sort of applicable to a bookmark storage and sharing site.

Your bookmarks should have the following properties
-URL, Name, Date Saved

Add validations for the URL and Name fields (3 pts)
-URL: must be present, must be at least 10 characters long
